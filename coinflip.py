# Questions:

# 1.            Find Cost of Tile to Cover W x H Floor â€“

# Calculate the total cost of tile it would take to cover a floor plan of width and height, using a cost entered by the user.
# 2.            Find max combination of 2 numbers in a sequence - n^2

# 3.            Write some code that simulates flipping a single coin however many times the user decides. The code should record the outcomes and count the number of tails and heads.

# 4.            Enter a string and the program will reverse it and print it out.

# 5.            Reads a file of records, sorts them, and then writes them back to the file. Allow the user to choose various sort style and sorting based on a particular field.
